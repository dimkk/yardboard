In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks.[11] During Martin's childhood, his world consisted predominantly of \"First Street to Fifth Street\", between his grade school and his home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, so he became a voracious reader.[13] The young Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included."

Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother.[12] She calls herself Jo.[13] Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business."
